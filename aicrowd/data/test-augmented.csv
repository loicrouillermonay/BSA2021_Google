"Dans son ouvrage, Mitra-Varuna, Dumézil signale qu'aux Indes comme à Rome, il y a deux manières pour le pouvoir viril de s'affirmer : en Varouna et Romulus, dans les Gandharvas et les Luperques, il est agression, rapt, désordre, hybris ; alors la femme apparaît comme un être qu'il faut ravir, violenter ; les Sabines ravies se montrent stériles, on les fouette avec des lanières en peau de bouc, compensant par la violence un excès de violence. Mais Mitra, Numa, les Brahmanes et les Flamines assurent au contraire l'ordre et l'équilibre raisonnable de la cité : alors la femme est liée au mari par un mariage aux rites compliqués et, collaborant avec lui, elle lui assurela domination de toutes les forces femelles de la nature ; à Rome, si la flamina meurt, le flamen dialis se démet de ses fonctions.",804,139,4.7913669064748206,55.0,2.5272727272727273,12.0,5.0,12.0,35.0,20.0,3.0,22.0,11.0,10.0,25.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,20.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"In his work, Mitra-Varuna, Dumézil indicates that in India as in Rome, there are two ways for manly power to assert itself: in Varouna and Romulus, in the Gandharvas and the Luperques, it is aggression, kidnapping, disorder, hybris; then the woman appears as a being who must be ravished, violated; the delighted Sabines show themselves sterile, they are whipped with goatskin thongs, compensating by violence an excess of violence.
