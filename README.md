## 1. Introduction

### The premise of the project

You have decided to form a startup called “LingoRank” with two of your University friends and
become a millionaire. You have until June to create a proof of concept for your investors. Your
startup will revolutionize the way people learn and get better at a foreign language.

You have noticed that, to improve one’s skills in a new foreign language, it is important to read
texts in that language. These text have to be at the reader’s language level. However, it is difficult
to find texts that are close to someone’s knowledge level (A1 to C2). You have decided to build a
model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. This can be then
used, e.g., in a recommendation system, to recommend texts (for example, recent news articles)
that are appropriate for someone’s language level. If someone is at A1 French level, it is
inappropriate to present a text at B2 level, as she won’t be able to understand it. Ideally, a text
should have many known words and may have a few words that are unknown so that the person
can improve.

The project is conducted in multiple milestones that are due throughout the semester.

### Milestone 1 - Reading/Thinking & Gathering the data

The first milestone is to research the subject by reading scientific publications in order to be able to think about how to solve the problem. We ask ourselves questions such as:

- Will we solve the problem as a classification problem, a regression problem, or in another way?
- Will the model analyze the difficulty of each word separately or a sentence as a whole?
- How will the data be collected and labeled in order to train the model?

Secondly, we apply our data collection strategy.
